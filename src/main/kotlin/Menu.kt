//Once data is in suitable state to be worked on menu functional will begin working

//menu function is user navigation so an input request will be put through 'amend, search... etc' and then the user
//will input their request and menu will run the requested function.
//Using a while loop and boolean we can keep the user in the same function if they wish to make repeats
//and once the user has completed their requests in that function they can use a 'go back' feature where the boolean returns false
//so they are returned to menu.
//same logic can apply for putting menu into a while loop so the user never accidentally ends the process.
